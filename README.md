# Logseq Image Reformatter for Obsidian

This plugin converts Obsidian-style image embeds to standard Markdown format, making your notes compatible with Logseq and other standard Markdown editors.

## Purpose

Obsidian uses a non-standard format for embedding images: `![[image.png]]`

This plugin converts those links to standard Markdown format: `![image](../assets/image.png)`
